# Ediam vFrontiers

This repository contains all supporting scripts and data sets required for replicating the analysis presented in Edmundo Molina-Perez et al, (2020) "Computational intelligence for studying sustainability challenges: tools and methods for dealing with deep uncertainty and complexity"

Scripts:
1. ClimateCalibration.r: describes the method for determining model's climate coefficients using GCMs raw data
2. Ediam_vFrontiers.r : contains mathematical structure of Ediam model an describes how the input from experimental design is processed into the model to estimate the output used in the analysis
3. Main_vFrontiers.r : describes the routines for a) creating the experimental design, b) estimating the optimal policy response across policy regimes, and c) data post-processing  for scenario discovery and data visualization.
4. sdprim_vFrontiers.r : describes routines and analyses carried out for applying the Patient Rule Induction Method (PRIM) algorithm to experimental results.
